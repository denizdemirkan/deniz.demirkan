## ðŸš€ About Me
Iâ€™m studying Computer Engineering in DumlupÄ±nar University. Iâ€™m in 3rd grade now and my graduation will be in two year.

Since June of 2022 I work voluntarily in ArgeLabs Technology. Iâ€™ve done Telegram Bot Project that is communicate with other APIâ€™s.

I mainly focused on Back-End Technologies like **Micro Services**, **NTier Architecture**, **ORM Providers** and so on. Every new learning excites me.

I always try to make my codes clean and maintainable by follow principles of **SOLID**, **DRY**, **KISS**, and like that.

I have good knowledge on ORM Providers like **Hibernate** and **Entity Framework**. I generally code in .NET and also in Java. It is very easy to switch Languages and Platforms as long as being proficient in OOP.

I like **HackerRank** and sometimes Iâ€™m trying to solve algorithm problems there. I have 4 silver star for now and it will be 5 golden star very soon.
